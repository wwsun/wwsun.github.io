## Project 1: Build an LLM Playground

LLM Overview and Foundations  
Pre-Training

- Data collection (manual crawling, Common Crawl)
- Data cleaning (RefinedWeb, Dolma, FineWeb)
- Tokenization (e.g., BPE)
- Architecture (neural networks, Transformers, GPT family, DeepSeek, Qwen, Gemma)
- Text generation (greedy and beam search, top-k, top-p)
  Post-Training
- SFT
- RL and RLHF (verifiable tasks, reward models, PPO, etc.)
  Evaluation
- Traditional metrics
- Task-specific benchmarks
- Human evaluation and leaderboards
  Chatbots' Overall Design

- GANs
- Auto-regressive models
- Diffusion models
  Text-to-Image (T2I)
- Data preparation
- Diffusion architectures (U-Net, DiT)
- Diffusion training (forward process, backward process)
- Diffusion sampling
- Evaluation (image quality, diversity, image-text alignment, IS, FID, and CLIP score)
  Text-to-Video (T2V)
- Latent-diffusion modeling (LDM) and compression networks
- Data preparation (filtering, standardization, video latent caching)
- DiT architecture for videos
- Large-scale training challenges
- T2V's overall system

## Project 6: Capstone Project

Ship a portfolio-ready AI project from idea to demo

- Choose: pick your own idea, or start from a curated list
- Build: implement using techniques from the course
- Iterate: get real-time feedback from the instructor as you build
- Optional Demo: present your project on final demo day
