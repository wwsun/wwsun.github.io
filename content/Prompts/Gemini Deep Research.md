2026 First Half Planning and Goal Setting for the Digital Collaboration Technology Team, Technical Department, an Internet Company

Current Team Status:
- overmind project management and application release, server-side release, mobile-side release
- febase frontend application release, nodejs application release
- team-ai AI Agent service infrastructure
- Knowledge Engineering (Document RAG, CodeWiki)
- AI Code Review (Adoption rate 60%, insufficient generalization ability for custom reviews)
- AI Test Text Case Generation/Review (Adoption rate 39%, coverage rate for new cases 85%)

Key Focus Areas:
- AI Agent knowledge engineering -- knowledge generation, mining, governance, retrieval, management
- Open CR Agents, generalized CR capabilities -> rule customization -> Skills + Sub-Agents customization, adoption rate gradually increases to 90%;
- Activity domain Coding autonomous intelligent agents: solving pain point problems, design to code, Spec-Driven-Development as a service + engineering, E2E Test.

Planning approach:
- From assistance to delegation: Evolving from simple process integration to supporting task delegation and backend operational capabilities, enabling the Agent to become a deeply involved participant in the process.
- Improving delivery efficiency in activity application development scenarios: Solving core bottlenecks and pain points in consumer-facing activities, such as implementing Design to Code, Spec-Driven-Development models, and integrating and automating E2E Test processes.
- Knowledge engineering: Comprehensive upgrade of knowledge engineering capabilities, supporting efficient, accurate, and timely knowledge synchronization, precise knowledge retrieval, and more user-friendly knowledge generation.

Task objectives:
- The important outcomes we must achieve this cycle (why they are important, how to achieve them, what happens if we fail)
- Set OKRs

Output requirements:
- Results should be in Simplified Chinese
